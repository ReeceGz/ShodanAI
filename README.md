# ShodanAI

ShodanAI is a Discord chat bot that emulates the malevolent AI from System Shock. It uses the Together AI hosted Llama 3 language model via an OpenAI-compatible API to generate responses in Shodan's signature style. Conversation histories are stored locally so the AI can maintain context over multiple interactions.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js** (ES module syntax; tested with Node 18+)
- **discord.js** v14 for interacting with the Discord API
- **openai** client for calling Together AI's Llama 3 model
- **dotenv** for environment variable management
- **node-fetch** for HTTP requests (used by the OpenAI client)
- Builtâ€‘in **fs** module for persisting conversation history in the `convos/` folder

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd ShodanAI
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file** in the project root with your credentials:
   ```bash
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
   TOGETHER_API_KEY=your_together_ai_api_key
   ```

4. **Run the bot**
   ```bash
   node bot.js
   ```

The bot will log in to Discord and begin listening for mentions. Conversation logs are saved under `convos/` on each run.

## Usage

Invite the bot to your server and mention it in a channel. When you tag the bot with a question or message, it will reply in the style of SHODAN. Messages and replies are stored so that follow-up conversations maintain context (up to a limit of recent turns).
